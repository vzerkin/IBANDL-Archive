Comment: Elastic Scattering of Protons from Chromium 
by W. R. Wylie, F. Zamboni and W. Zych Physikinstitut der Universitat Zurich
Summary. Elastic scattering of protons from chromium has been 
measured in the energy range 2.4-4.1 MeV. Only one of many strong
resonances is attributed to an analogue state to an excited level
with J = 3/2- at Ex = 2.321 MeV in 53Cr. The Coulomb energy
displacement is given as DEc = (8.354 +/- 0.005) MeV. 
Experimental Method
  Protons from a 5.5 MeV-HVEC-van-de-Graaff accelerator were used to
bombard targets of natural and enriched chromium evaporated on carbon
foils. For the excitation curves between 2.4 MeV and 4.1 MeV proton
energy target thicknesses of 40 mcg/cm^2 of natural chromium on carbon
of 8 mcg/cm^2 were used. To obtain better energy resolution limited
energy regions were investigated with targets of 52Cr(99.72% enriched)
of 2 mcg/cm^2 thickness on 5 mcg/cm^2 carbon foils. The beam energy
spread was about 100 eV per MeV proton energy. The scattered protons
were detected by standard methods. At all angles it was easy to
distinguish the protons scattered on chromium from the ones scattered
on carbon and oxygen contaminant.
Data were digitized from a figure. Units are relative (counts).
