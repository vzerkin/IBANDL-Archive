 For the measurement of the recoil cross section for
the 1H(4He,4He)1H reaction. V2H plates of 1 mm
thickness were prepared by the hydrogen gas reaction of
vanadium uring a Sieverts Type apparatus. The amount
of hydrogen absorbed in the plates was evaluated from
its temperature, pressure and volume.
 The differential recoil cross section was determined
by measuring the height of the ERD spectra for V2H as
a function of the incident 4He energy. In determining
the cross section, it is necessary to know the solid angle
subtended by the detector as well as the irradiation dose
of the analysing beam. Both quantities were evaluated
from measurements of the Rufherford scattering yields
from an Au foil under the same experimenlal condi-
tions. The error associated wilh the measurement is 
estimated to be about ~5% for the differential cross section.
The data are given in lab system.
