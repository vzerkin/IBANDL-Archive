Comment: "Measurement of (p,p) and (p,a) cross sections for lithium
and fluorine", G.M.Lerner and J.B.Marion - Nucl.Instr& Meth.
69(1969)115.
Simultaneous measurements have been made of the differential
cross sections (Ep = 1.36 MeV, THETAlab = 90 deg) for the
6Li(p,p)6Li,7Li(p.p)7Li,19F(p,p)19F, 6Li(p,a)3He,7Li(p,a)4He
and 19F(p,a0)16O reactions using LiF targets. The measurements
provide a consistent set of cross sections for calibration
purposes. The results are generally in agreement with previous
cross section determinations except for the case of the
19F(p,a0)16O reaction which is discussed in detail.
The data are given in lab system.
