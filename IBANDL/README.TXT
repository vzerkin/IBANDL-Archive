This is an archive of the Ion Beam Analysis Nuclear Data Library developed 
and maintained by the IAEA. It contains available experimental nuclear 
cross-sections relevant to Ion Beam Analysis. The numerical data are in the 
R33 format. Currently, most of the data are being extracted from EXFOR 
using an automatic conversion procedure available in EXFOR retrieval system.

Two Coordinated Research Projects (CRP) have catered to the data needs of 
the IBA community: the CRP on Reference Database for Ion Beam Analysis 
(2005-2010, see: IAEA-TECDOC-1780), and the CRP on Development of a Reference 
Database for Particle-Induced Gamma Ray Emission (PIGE) Spectroscopy 
(2011-2015, see: IAEA-TECDOC-1822). Both CRPs produced new measurements 
that form the bulk of IBANDL. 

Members of the IBA community are invited to submit new experimental data 
to IBANDL. Numerical data (in R33 or any other format) including references 
should be sent to IAEA-NDS: nds.contact-point@iaea.org

When citing data retrieved from IBANDL both the original article and the 
database should be referenced.
